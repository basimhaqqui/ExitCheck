    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does ExitCheck need "Always" location access?</h3>
        <p>ExitCheck uses geofencing to detect when you leave your home zone. For this to work even when the app is closed, iOS requires "Always" location permission. Don't worry - we only monitor your home zone and your location data never leaves your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will ExitCheck drain my battery?</h3>
        <p>No. ExitCheck uses Apple's efficient geofencing technology, which is built into iOS. Unlike GPS tracking apps, geofencing uses minimal battery because it only activates when you cross your home boundary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I change my home location?</h3>
        <p>Go to Settings within the app and tap on "Home Location" to update your home address or adjust the zone radius.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I have multiple home locations?</h3>
        <p>Currently, ExitCheck supports one home location. We're considering adding support for multiple locations (like work or gym) in future updates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why didn't I get a notification when I left home?</h3>
        <p>Check the following:
        <br>1. Ensure location permission is set to "Always" in iOS Settings
        <br>2. Make sure notifications are enabled for ExitCheck
        <br>3. Verify your home location is set correctly
        <br>4. Check that the app shows "Active" status on the home screen</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>Yes, completely. All your data (location, checklist items, statistics) is stored locally on your device only. We never collect, transmit, or share any of your information. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored on your device, you can delete everything by uninstalling the app. You can also delete individual checklist items by swiping left on them.</p>
